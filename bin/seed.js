With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears.Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.Sprinkle with salt.With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.",
